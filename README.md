# Customer-segmentation
## Project Overview:
- K Means Clustering
Online retail is a transational data set which contains all the transaction occuring between 1/12/2010 and 9/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

What we want to acheive?
Segment the Customers based on RFM so that the company can target its customers efficiently.

R(Recency) : Number of days since last purchase
F(Frequency) : Number of transactions
M (Monetary) : Total amount of transactions(revenue contribution)

# Library used : 
-Numpy
-Pandas
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-Sklearn -- sklearn.cluster import KMeans
KMeans Defination :
 ANS : The k-means clustering algorithm operates by categorizing data points into clusters by using a mathematical distance measure, usually euclidean, from the cluster center. The objective is to minimize the sum of distances between data points and their assigned clusters.
